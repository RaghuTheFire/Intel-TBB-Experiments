# Utilities which uses the power of Intel Threaded Building Blocks
# OpenCvRTSPIntelTBBDemo.cpp
This C++ code demonstrates the use of the Intel Threading Building Blocks (TBB) library and the OpenCV library to read and process an RTSP (Real-Time Streaming Protocol) video stream in a parallel manner. 
Here's a breakdown of the code: 
1. The code includes the necessary header files: `<iostream>` for input/output operations, `<thread>` for working with threads, `<tbb/tbb.h>` for the TBB library, and `<opencv2/opencv.hpp>` for the OpenCV library.
2. The `processFrame` function is defined, which takes a `const Mat&` (a reference to an OpenCV `Mat` object representing a frame) as input. This function is responsible for processing the frame, in this case, it simply displays the frame using `imshow` and `waitKey`.
3. The `readRTSPStream` function is defined, which takes a `const string&` (a reference to a string) representing the RTSP stream URL as input. This function opens the RTSP stream using `VideoCapture`, and then continuously reads frames from the stream using `cap.read(frame)`. Each frame is then passed to the `processFrame` function for processing. 4. The `main` function is the entry point of the program. It first sets the RTSP stream URL to a placeholder value, which should be replaced with the actual RTSP stream URL.
5. The code then initializes the TBB task scheduler using `tbb::task_scheduler_init init`.
6. The core of the program is the `tbb::parallel_for` loop, which is used to read the RTSP stream in parallel using multiple threads. The loop iterates over the range of available threads (determined by the default number of threads in the TBB task scheduler) and calls the `readRTSPStream` function for each thread.

In summary, this code sets up a parallel processing pipeline to read and process an RTSP video stream using the TBB library and the OpenCV library. The `tbb::parallel_for` loop allows the RTSP stream to be read and processed concurrently, potentially improving the overall performance of the application.

# OpenCvRTSPIntelTBBDemo2.cpp
This C++ code is a multi-threaded application that retrieves video frames from multiple RTSP (Real-Time Streaming Protocol) streams and displays them in a window using the OpenCV library. 
Here's a breakdown of the code: 
1. The code includes the necessary header files for input/output, vectors, threads, mutexes, condition variables, queues, and the OpenCV library.
2. It declares global variables: - `rtsp_urls`: a vector to store the RTSP stream URLs. - `frame_queue`: a concurrent queue to store the video frames. - `queue_mutex`: a mutex to protect the access to the frame queue. - `queue_cv`: a condition variable to signal when frames are available in the queue. - `stop_threads`: a flag to signal the threads to stop.
3. The `grab_frame` function is responsible for retrieving frames from a single RTSP stream. It opens the video capture, reads frames, and pushes them into the `frame_queue`. This function runs in a loop until the `stop_threads` flag is set.
4. The `display_frames` function is responsible for displaying the frames from the `frame_queue`. It waits for frames to be available in the queue, then retrieves and displays them using OpenCV's `imshow` and `waitKey` functions. This function also runs in a loop until the `stop_threads` flag is set.
5. The `main` function: - Loads the RTSP stream URLs from configuration files (or a hardcoded list in this example). - Starts the frame grabbing threads, one for each RTSP stream. - Starts the frame display thread. - Waits for user input to stop the program. - Sets the `stop_threads` flag to signal the threads to stop. - Waits for all the threads to finish.
6. The purpose of this code is to provide a multi-threaded solution for retrieving and displaying video frames from multiple RTSP streams simultaneously.
7. The use of a concurrent queue and condition variables ensures that the frame grabbing and display processes are synchronized and efficient.

# RingBufferIntelTBB.cpp
This C++ code demonstrates the use of a concurrent ring buffer, which is a data structure that allows for the storage and retrieval of elements in a circular fashion. The code uses the Intel Threading Building Blocks (TBB) library to implement the concurrent operations. 
Here's a breakdown of the code: 
1. The `RingBuffer` class is defined, which has a `push` method to add elements to the buffer and a `pop` method to remove elements from the buffer. The buffer is implemented using the `tbb::concurrent_bounded_queue` class from the TBB library, which provides thread-safe concurrent access to the queue.
2. In the `main` function, a `RingBuffer` of integers is created with a size of 10.
3. The `tbb::parallel_for` function is used to create multiple threads (4 in this case) that push items into the ring buffer. Each thread pushes an item with a value equal to its thread index multiplied by 10 (e.g., thread 0 pushes 0, thread 1 pushes 10, etc.).
4. Another `tbb::parallel_for` function is used to create multiple threads (again, 4 in this case) that pop items from the ring buffer. Each thread pops an item and prints it to the console.
The purpose of this code is to demonstrate the use of a concurrent ring buffer, where multiple threads can safely push and pop items from the buffer without causing race conditions or other concurrency issues. The TBB library provides the necessary synchronization primitives to ensure the thread-safe operation of the buffer.

This C++ code demonstrates the usage of OpenCV's parallel processing capabilities using Intel's Threading Building Blocks (TBB) library. 
Here's a breakdown of the code: 
1. The code includes necessary headers for OpenCV, threading, and chrono (for timing).
2. The `IMAGE_HEIGHT` constant is set to 20, which affects how many tasks OpenCV splits the processing into.
3. The `reportThreads()` function sleeps for 100 milliseconds to ensure the process reported thread count is up-to-date, then prints the number of threads used by OpenCV.
4. The `runTbb()` function creates a grayscale image with a height of `IMAGE_HEIGHT` and a width of 1000 pixels, fills it with random values, calculates the histogram of the image using OpenCV's `calcHist()` function, and prints a message indicating that TBB was used. It also calls `reportThreads()`.
5. The `runTbbThread()` function calls `reportThreads()` and then calls `runTbb()` twice.
6. In the `main()` function:
- The initial number of threads used by OpenCV is printed.
- The number of threads used by OpenCV is set to 3 using `cv::setNumThreads(3)`.
- `reportThreads()` is called to print the updated number of threads.
- `runTbb()` is called twice.
- A new thread is created using `std::thread` and `runTbbThread()` is executed in that thread.
- The main thread waits for the new thread to finish using `thread.join()`.
- `reportThreads()` is called again to print the number of threads after the new thread finishes.
- `runTbb()` is called twice more. The purpose of this code is to demonstrate how OpenCV can utilize multiple threads for parallel processing, and how the number of threads can be controlled using `cv::setNumThreads()`.

The code creates a separate thread and runs the `runTbbThread()` function in that thread, which in turn calls `runTbb()` twice, utilizing the TBB library for parallel processing. Note that the code includes a comment mentioning that calling `cv::setNumThreads(3)` inside the `runTbbThread()` function would cause a segmentation fault when `runTbb()` is called outside that thread. This is likely due to thread safety issues when modifying the number of threads used by OpenCV from multiple threads simultaneously.
